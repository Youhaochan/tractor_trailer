mobile robot with trailer Simulator
=================
# Note: the chassis is diff drive, once I figure out how to make this model works correctly, i will replace the diff drive as ackerman drive

1. Run **roslaunch trailer_description display.launch** to show the model in rviz
2. Run **roslaunch trailer_gazebo tractor_trailer.launch** to load the model in rviz and gazebo
